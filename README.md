# ReiterJulia.jl: a Julia implementation of Reiter (2009)

This repository aims at solving a simple Aiyagari model with aggregate productivity shocks using the method Michael Reiter delineated in his 2009 paper *Solving heterogeneous-agent models by projection and perturbation*. The resolution is carried in the `main.jl` file. The code is extensively commented and documented. The notations are kept as close as possible to those in Reiter's paper. Further explanations are available in the `demo.ipynb` notebook. 

The functions and methods can be adapted to more complicated models. The general structure of the code is still relevant to solve many heterogeneous-agent models.
